 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4]'
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is
 * equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
 *
 * The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit
 * integer.
 *
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the
 * division operation.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
 * Output: [24,12,8,6]
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
 * Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
 * The input is generated such that answer[i] is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit
 * integer.
 *
 *
 *
 * Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The
 * output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)
