#
# We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
#
# I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked (the
# number I picked stays the same throughout the game).
#
# Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is
# higher or lower than your guess.
#
# You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible
# results:
#
#
# -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
# 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
# 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
#
#
# Return the number that I picked.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: n = 10, pick = 6
# Output: 6
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: n = 1, pick = 1
# Output: 1
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: n = 2, pick = 1
# Output: 1
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
# 1 <= pick <= n

# @lc code=start
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, n
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            g = guess(mid)
            if g == -1:
                right = mid - 1
            elif g == 1:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                return mid
